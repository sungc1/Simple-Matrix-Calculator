# Simple-Matrix-Calculator

This is matrix calculator with some simple function.
=======
It's my first time to upload my code to Github and share to everyone. Sincerely, a little bit excited :D

This calculator have the functions of addition & subtraction & multiplication & transposition & inversing & determinant & LU factorization.

I have finished it at the end of Year 2 Semester 1 on Dec. 2019. I submitted it as my project. However, there are still plenty of things need to improve, if you find something confusing in my code please take it easy.

Hope this project would help you~
Just have fun~
