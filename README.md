# Simple-Matrix-Calculator

This is matrix calculator with some simple function.
=======
It's my first time to upload code to Github and share to everyone. Sincerely, a little bit exciting :D

This calculator have the functions to calculate addition & subtraction & multiplication & transposition & inversing & determinant & LU factorization.

I have finished it at the end of Year 2 Semester 1 on Dec. 2019. I submitted as my project. There are still plenty of things I need to improve, if you find something confusing in my code please take it easy.

Hope this project would help you~
Just have fun~
